# routing-rocks-policy-role
Bird 2.x routing policy used in routing-rocks (AS202739), Freifunk Essen (AS206356), etc.

## AS-Sets
The policy expects files definitions of the AS_SET parameters used in the inventory in the as-sets directory. In my setups these prefix lists are auto generated via cron. This tooling will be open sourced in the future.
